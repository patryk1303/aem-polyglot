# AEM Polyglot

This tool is designed mainly for developers who are tasked to translate automatically AEM dictionaries into other languages. 

Naturally you could use built into AEM a translation project, however this tool can do the job quickly and without a need to even start AEM. 

## What's under the hood?

In order to translate entries we are using Yandex Translation API. It's free to use (for smaller quotes) and does not require from a developer nothing more then setting up an account an creation of an API key. 

On the other hand Google Translate API enforces user to provide credit card data on the spot in orde to get the key.   

## Installation

1. `npm install -g aem-polyglot`



## Usage

TODO - mention something on how to prove Yandex API key

## Development
